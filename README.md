# Blog

This is still a work in progress (very much so), but I have focused heavily on wanting to make this blog using the Markdown language along with several mixins to it. 

Features are currently:
- Syntax Highlighting with Prism (or Highlight.JS)
- Math rendering with KaTeX
- Backend to serve blog posts

## Screenshots

The app is in very early stages aesthetically and I have been focused on getting my core rendering features to work.

## Future Features

I want to make this into a fully fledged open source blogging application designed for engineering students, especially Computer Science students, to be able to have a decent blog so that they can free to write whatever they want. I don't want people to feel restricted about what they can/can't put on their site easily anymore. 

Ideas include:

- adding files
- adding html snippets
- basic login, OAuth
- add/delete/edit/comment for posts
- user profiles
- basic permissions system
- ... and other random ones I come up with.
